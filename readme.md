# Project ID1 - Interactive Eredivisie data visualization dashboard

For this individual project I've made a interactive data visualization dashboard of different datasets of the dutch football league Eredivisie.

## Background

First I've chosen a dataset from 'fivethirtyeight'. This data consist all of the Terrorism Fatalities in Europe between 1970 and 2014.
This was a clean dataset because I couldn't find a dirty one right away and didn't want to waste a lot of time. Instead I focused more on creating a nice interactive data visualization. I've made a map were you get an overview of all the total terrorism fatalities in Europe by country. If you click on a country you can see the fatalities by year in a line graph.

**Steps**

## Changes

### index.html

- Linked Javascript and CSS files.
- Added heading
- Added container

### index.css

- Added basic styles to the body and heading
- Added styles to `svg`'s

### index.js
- Imported data
- Added map of Europe
- Added tooltip for map
- Added legend for map
- Added line graph

## Data

The data I chose consist all of the Goals scorers in the Eredivisie between 1960 and 2017 and originates from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/terrorism/eu_terrorism_fatalities_by_country.csv). This was a clean dataset because I couldn't find a dirty one right away and didn't want to waste a lot of time. However I've edited and cleaned the dataset by myself so it works together with the used graphs.

By downloading this dataset, I got a `csv` file where all of the topscorers separated in columns. Like this:

year | Belgium | France | Denmark | Germany | Italy | ..
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1970 | 0 | 2 | 43 | 54 | 6 | ..
1971 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 46 | 0 | ..
1972 | 0 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 0 | ..


- `year` -- Year of research
- `country` -- The country
- `value` -- Amount of fatalities
